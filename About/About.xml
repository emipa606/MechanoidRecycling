Update of Porohkun, Gerusz mod 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=843280654

Replaced original dissasemble-code with patching, replacing the Steel for MechanoidElectronicPart and Plasteel for MechanoidHullPart.
This should make it more compatible with other machanoid-mods.

You dont know what to do with dead mechanoids? Recycle them! Detach bionic arms and legs or full disassemle on electric and hull parts.

You can disassemble mechanoids into its component parts and create of them bionic prostheses.
